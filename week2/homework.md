# Question 1 - What's the initial prompt you gave to AI to start the implementation?
Act as an expert full stack developer. Implement a platform for online coding interviews. Go step by step. These are the steps:

Frontend (mock backend and create unit test for the frontend)
OpenAPI specs (define communication between frontend and backend)
Backend (create functionality according to openapi specs, mock frontend, create unit tests for backend)
connect frontend and backend and create integration tests, make sure it works together
The app should be able to do the following:

Create a link and share it with candidates
Allow everyone who connects to edit code in the code panel
Show real-time updates to all connected users
Support syntax highlighting for multiple languages
Execute code safely in the browser
Use the following technologies: Frontend: React + Vite Backend: Express.js

Now start with the frontend, but keep the rest in mind.
# Question 2 - What's the terminal command you use for executing tests?
`npm test`

- finish integration tests, should not be skipped
- make sure all md files are updated
